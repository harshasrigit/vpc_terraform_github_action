# VPC_Terraform_Github_Action

Creating VPC Iaac and github Action as CICD
In this tutorial video, we'll walk you through creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure using Terraform and then automating the deployment of your Terraform code using GitHub Actions. Whether you're new to infrastructure as code (IAC) or looking to streamline your deployment workflow, this video covers all of it.🚀

Here's what you can expect to learn:
1. Setting up Terraform: We'll guide you through the initial setup of Terraform on your local machine, ensuring you have the necessary tools and configurations in place.🛠️

2. Writing Terraform Code: You'll see how to write Terraform code to define your VPC infrastructure, including networks, subnets, security groups, and more. We'll provide clear explanations and best practices along the way.📝

3. Initializing and Applying Terraform: Learn how to initialize your Terraform project and apply your code to create the VPC in your cloud provider.🌟

4. GitHub Repository Setup: We'll guide you through setting up a GitHub repository to store your Terraform code, including creating a README, .gitignore, and other essential files.📂

5. GitHub Actions Configuration: Discover how to configure GitHub Actions workflows to automate the deployment of your Terraform code. We'll cover secrets management and workflow triggers on pushing the code to a specific branch.⚙️

6. Push to GitHub: See how to push your Terraform code to your GitHub repository and trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.📦

7. Monitor and Verify: Learn how to monitor the progress of your GitHub Actions workflow and verify the successful deployment of your VPC infrastructure.🧐

By the end of this video, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and how to automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions.
